# What is Axios and Why Use It?

**Axios** is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It is promise-based, meaning it handles asynchronous requests and provides you with the flexibility to manage responses easily.

**Why Use Axios:**

1. **Easy to Use:** Simple syntax and straightforward API.
2. **Promise-based:** Helps in managing asynchronous code.
3. **Browser Support:** Optimized for modern browsers.
4. **Interceptors:** Provides the ability to modify requests and responses.
5. **Cancel Requests:** You can cancel HTTP requests if needed.
6. **Automatic JSON Data Transformation:** Automatically converts response data to JSON format.

## Code Explanation

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Importing Axios:**
   - `const axios = require("axios");`
     - This line imports the Axios library.

2. **API URL:**
   - `const url = "https://dummyjson.com/users";`
     - This line defines the API URL from which user data will be fetched.

3. **getRequest Function:**
   - This function is created to handle GET requests and manage retries if the request fails.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `url`: The API URL.
     - `retries`: The number of times to retry (default is 3).
   - **Promise:** The function returns a promise. If the request is successful, the data is resolved; if it fails, the error is rejected.

4. **Error Handling and Retries:**
   - If the request fails and there are retries left, the function is called again (`getRequest(url, retries - 1)`).

5. **Main Function:**
   - This is an asynchronous function that calls the `getRequest` function and prints the data to the console.
   - If any error occurs at any step, the catch block logs the error message.
